# Post number 1, Today I start to post
### Camera gear

So I've always been the family member to film everybody and document trips, that my passion, to preserve memories, to capture them forever.
For that mission I've aquired over few years some gear which I wanted to talk about in this post.

For each camera/tool there is a different purpose, as they all have different strong and weak points.

# 1.   GoPro
 GoPro can be used for these cases

 - front face vlog
 - head cam/pov
 
1. For front face vlog the point is that the main camera is on the front with a display you can adjust the frame to, you dont have the same with your phone or dslr, the main camera is behind the screen
2. headcam is useful for capturing pov shots for example:
    - catching a fish moment
    - driving an old lada
    - biking somewhere
    - child pov

aditional pros:
- replaceable batteries
- lightweight

# 2. Phone
Phone is goat for quick people portrait, the fake blur does the job
strong
