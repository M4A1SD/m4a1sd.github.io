# My Shoe Box
### Camera gear

So I've always been the family member to film everybody and document trips, thats my passion, to preserve memories, to capture them forever.
For that mission I've aquired over few years some gear which I wanted to talk about in this post.

For each camera/tool there is a different purpose, as they all have different strong and weak points.

# 1.   GoPro
 GoPro can be used for these cases

 - front face vlog
 - head cam/pov
 
1. For front-face vlog the point is that the main camera is on the front with a display you can adjust the frame to, you dont have the same with your phone or dslr, the main camera is behind the screen
2. headcam is useful for capturing pov shots for example:
    - catching a fish moment
    - driving an old lada
    - biking somewhere
    - child pov

aditional pros:
- replaceable batteries
- lightweight

# 2. Phone
####  Phone is goat for quick people portrait.

the quickness of the phone is the strongest point, it doesn't even matter that the blur is fake, it does the job very well and the time you save is huge.
- portable
- also great for video recording  

# 3. DSLR
This one thing I found works great, is the ability to highlight the atmosphere, and focus on small details. 
the deph of field helps you to zone things out and bring viewers attention on to your subject. besides that, its great low light performer.

additional helpful gear would be:
